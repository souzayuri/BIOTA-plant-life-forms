# BIOTA-plant-life-form
Scripts that I wrote during my master's project to analyze the effects of defaunation on plant life form pattern.

These folders contain part of my personal development with data manipulation and analyses with R.

Some of these scripts are outdated because it was part of my firsts learning, and I did not optimized it after get new programmer skills.

The most recent and optimized scripts start with a header that contains script description and last updated data, and also have some notes with a description of functions or syntax throughout the script.

Here I make available the scripts and main data table to make it works.
